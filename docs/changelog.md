# Changelog

All notable changes to the **Hibiscus** project will be documented in this file.

## [v0.13.1] - Pipeline Auto-Scan, Binary Safety, Document Viewers

### Critical Bug Fixes

- **Binary file data destruction** (`useEditorController`): Multiple code paths could silently zero out PDF and DOCX files. Monaco stays mounted and hidden while a binary document is active, meaning it was still bound to an empty placeholder buffer. Any change event (including accidental keystrokes while the hidden editor was focused), auto-save debounce, Save As, the unmount handler, or session restore could reach `write_text_file` with that empty string and permanently destroy the document. All five paths now check `isBinaryFile(path)` and bail out early. 8 regression tests in `tests/binaryFileSafety.test.ts` lock these invariants down.
- **DOCX tab closed on external edit**: The `fs-changed` handler called `read_text_file` on every open buffer path, including binary ones. Reading a DOCX as UTF-8 throws a decode error, which was caught and interpreted as "file deleted" — closing the tab. Binary paths are now skipped in the handler entirely.
- **Session restore losing binary tabs**: The restore path loaded all tabs as text, silently dropping PDFs and DOCX files that couldn't be decoded. Now uses `file_exists` (cheap existence check only) for binary paths and restores their tabs with the empty placeholder buffer intact.

### Knowledge Pipeline

- **Initial scan on workspace open** (`watcher.rs`): `watch_workspace` now calls `initial_scan()` automatically in a background thread before processing live events. Previously the knowledge base, graph, and topics stayed empty until the user manually edited each file — the pipeline was purely event-driven with no bootstrapping. The watcher emits `knowledge-indexing` (bool) and `knowledge-updated` events so the frontend can reflect scan progress.
- **O(n²) aggregate rebuild eliminated** (`queue.rs`): The scored index, topic map, and note metadata were each rebuilt after every individual file during a batch scan. For a workspace with 1000 files this was 3000 full rebuilds. Consolidated into `rebuild_aggregates()`, deferred during scans, and called exactly once at the end.
- **Case-insensitive topic normalisation** (`topics.rs`): Heading text is now title-cased before grouping, so `"introduction"`, `"Introduction"`, and `"INTRODUCTION"` from different documents all merge into the same topic.

### Parser Improvements

- **PDF — page provenance** (`parser.rs`): Switched to `pdf_extract::extract_text_by_pages()`. Each page becomes a separate section with `"Page N"` as the heading — search results now tell you which page a hit is on. Previously the entire document was one flat blob.
- **PDF — text normalisation**: `normalize_pdf_text()` rejoins layout line-breaks and de-hyphenates split words (`"knowl-\nedge"` → `"knowledge"`). Without this, PDF tokens were fragmented and never matched full search terms.
- **DOCX — heading structure recovered**: The DOCX parser now reads `<w:pStyle>` XML attributes to detect Word heading styles (`Heading1`–`Heading9`, `Title`, `Subtitle`, localised variants). Before this fix, every paragraph was treated as body text regardless of its style, so all Word content collapsed into the "General" topic with no structure.

### Document Viewers (`FileRenderer`)

- **PDF**: Renders all pages (was page 1 only). Container-width sizing via `ResizeObserver` (was `window.innerWidth`). Themed via CSS variables.
- **DOCX**: Cache invalidated on `fs-changed` — external edits now visible without restarting. HTML from mammoth sanitised via `DOMParser` (strips `<script>`, event handlers, `javascript:` URLs). Themed page-column layout via `FileRenderer.css`.
- **Document toolbar**: Read-only badge + "Extract to Note" action button on all binary viewers.

### Extract to Note

- New `extract_document_to_note` Tauri command (`knowledge/query.rs`): runs the full knowledge parser on a PDF or DOCX and writes a structured Markdown note alongside the original. YAML frontmatter records the `source:` path. Heading structure preserved (page numbers for PDF, Word heading styles for DOCX). Never overwrites existing notes (numbered suffixes). The indexer picks it up immediately as a regular note.

### New Tauri Commands

- `copy_file(source, destination)` — byte-accurate file copy for binary Save As.
- `file_exists(path)` — cheap existence check for session restore.
- `extract_document_to_note(source_path)` — PDF/DOCX → structured Markdown note.

### Knowledge Graph (Plan A)

- `useBackendKnowledge` is now the canonical graph source, replacing the ephemeral frontend-only `useKnowledgeIndex` for all graph and backlinks rendering. Reactive on `fs-changed` (600ms debounce) + `knowledge-updated` instead of a fixed 5-second poll.
- `BacklinksPanel` simplified to accept a resolved `string[]` — no longer touches `KnowledgeIndex` directly.
- `SearchPanel` surfaces indexing errors and skipped files from the backend status response.
- `KnowledgeGraphView` redesigned: categorical node colours + shapes (colour-blind safe), hub rings for high-degree nodes, hollow orphan rendering, amber edge highlight on hover, Fit/Relayout toolbar buttons, collapsible legend with shape glyphs.
- Drag zoom-out bug fixed: `alphaTarget` managed on drag start/end, forces bounded, camera re-centering suppressed while dragging.

## [v0.12.0] - Knowledge Base Robustness Overhaul

### Major Features
- **Status Dashboard**: Implemented a comprehensive UI dashboard tracking indexing health, chunk counts, schema versions, errors, and skipped files.
- **Repair UX**: Added explicit controls to rebuild or clear the knowledge base index directly from the user interface.
- **Backend Metadata Extraction**: The indexer now automatically parses Markdown files for wiki-links, tags, and YAML frontmatter aliases natively.
- **Workspace Exclusions**: Added support for `.hibiscusignore` to explicitly prevent specific directories and files from being indexed.

- **Phrase Parsing**: Implemented strict exact-phrase matching and dynamic boosting via quoted search queries.
- **Topic Filtering**: Allowed intersection-based topic filtering directly inside the TF-IDF query engine.
- **Line Navigation**: Search results now include precise `start_line` and `end_line` metadata, allowing the editor to auto-scroll directly to the extracted chunk.

### Architecture Improvements
- **Storage Hardening**: Migrated to `sha2` (SHA-256) for deterministic, cross-platform file content hashing.
- **Large File Bypassing**: Added an implicit 10MB file ceiling constraint to the indexer queue to strictly prevent application out-of-memory errors.
- **Mutex Write Locks**: Synchronized background indexing state writes within `KnowledgeState` using lock semantics to prevent data races.
- **Schema Tracking**: Incremented metadata formats to schema version 2 to manage extended location properties and graph resolution files gracefully.

## [v0.9.0] - Advanced Knowledge System (Phase 2)

### New Features

- **PDF & DOCX Document Support**: Extended the parsing system to handle PDF files using pdf-extract and DOCX files via zip+quick-xml streaming. Both parsers implement the existing Parser trait and include robust error handling for corrupt files.
- **TF-IDF Scored Search Index**: Implemented a sophisticated scoring system alongside the existing keyword index. Uses the formula `score = ln(1 + tf) * ln(total_chunks / df)` with precomputed scores for zero query-time calculation. Automatically filters common words appearing in >50% of chunks.
- **Intelligent Topic Grouping**: Added automatic topic extraction that groups chunks by heading text. Identical headings create the same topic, empty headings become "General", and small topics (<2 chunks) merge into "Miscellaneous". Uses BTreeMap for deterministic ordering.
- **Advanced Query Engine**: Enhanced search with multiple matching strategies - exact match (score + 0.5), prefix match (score \* 0.2), and fuzzy match with edit distance 1 (score \* 0.1). Supports multi-word queries with accumulated scoring and pagination (max 100 results).
- **High-Performance LRU Cache**: Implemented dual in-memory caches - query cache (128 entries) and chunk cache (256 entries). Uses VecDeque for better CPU cache locality than HashMap+LinkedList. All-or-nothing cache invalidation on file changes.
- **Extended Backend API**: Added new Tauri commands including `search_chunks` for ranked search with fuzzy/prefix support, and `get_topics` for topic retrieval. Enhanced existing commands with caching support.

### Architecture Improvements

- **Phase 1 Compatibility**: Maintains full backward compatibility - Phase 1 commands and storage remain untouched. Phase 2 extends via parallel data structures without breaking existing functionality.
- **Memory-Optimized Parsing**: DOCX parsing uses streaming XML to avoid loading entire documents into memory. PDF parsing extracts full text then splits on double newlines for pragmatic content separation.
- **Deterministic Performance**: Topic grouping uses BTreeMap and sorted chunk IDs for consistent results. Query processing includes early exit after 500 candidates per term to prevent performance degradation.
- **Robust File Handling**: Added large file guard (10MB threshold) that skips files at queue level before parsing begins. All parsers include proper error handling with IoError fallback for corrupt files.

### Storage Updates

- **New Storage Files**: Added `topics.json` for topic mappings and `scored_index.json` for TF-IDF data alongside existing Phase 1 storage.
- **Enhanced Storage Layout**: Updated `.hibiscus/knowledge/` structure to support both Phase 1 and Phase 2 data without migration requirements.
- **Optimized Index Structure**: Scored index caps at 200 chunk references per keyword to prevent memory bloat while maintaining search quality.

### Testing & Quality

- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Added 46 total tests with 10 new tests covering cache (4), indexer (1), query (4), and topics (1) modules.
- **Performance Validation**: Confirmed LRU cache outperforms HashMap+LinkedList for small cache sizes through CPU cache locality benefits.
- **Error Resilience**: All new parsers include comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation for corrupted or malformed files.

## [v0.8.0] - Knowledge Indexing System (Phase 1)

### New Features

- **Knowledge Indexing Pipeline**: Implemented a local-first, incremental knowledge indexing system that watches workspace files (`.md`, `.txt`) and processes them via a debounced async queue.
- **Worker Pool & Debounced Batching**: Added a background worker task with bounded concurrency and debounced batching for efficient per-file processing without blocking the main runtime.
- **Trait-Based Parser System**: Introduced a flexible parsing architecture including a `MarkdownParser` for heading-based splits and a `TxtParser` for paragraph-based splits.
- **Context-Aware Chunker**: Implemented an intelligent chunking engine that splits parsed sections into 200-500 word bounds while preserving heading context and using deterministic IDs.
- **Incremental Keyword Indexing**: Added a hash-based incremental keyword index that supports stopword filtering and normalization for rapid text retrieval.
- **Robust Storage Layer**: Built an optimized disk I/O layer utilizing buffered reads/writes, streaming file hashes, and individual chunk file storage to minimize memory footprint.
- **Query APIs**: Exposed new Tauri commands (`search_knowledge`, `get_chunk`, `rebuild_knowledge_index`) for frontend integration with the knowledge system.

### Architecture

- **State Management**: Integrated `Arc<KnowledgeState>` as a managed state within Tauri, properly spawning the worker during the setup hook to ensure safe cross-thread operations.
- **Watcher Integration**: Extended the existing `watch_workspace` to seamlessly accept `KnowledgeState` and securely forward filesystem events to the new knowledge queue.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Integrated essential Tokio features (`rt`, `rt-multi-thread`, `time`, `macros`) into the Cargo manifest to safely support native async routines.

### Bug Fixes

- **Threading Panic**: Replaced tokio runtime thread spawning with Tauri's native async runtime handling to prevent main thread panics when no existing tokio runtime was detected.
- **Macro Export Issues**: Updated the module root to accurately re-export the Tauri-facing API to prevent macro resolution bugs associated with `tauri::command`.
- **Code Consolidation**: Delegated all custom shared data types into a single unified file for cleaner dependency management across the workspace.

## [v0.7.2]

- **Bugfix**: Removed unused Open function causing typescript errors (lol)

## [v0.7.1]

- **Bugfix**:  Fixed bg selection and text selection inconsistency wherein the selection text was stuck at a bright red despite theme changes

## [v0.7.0] - New Item Modal System

### New Features

- **Production-Grade Modal System**: Implemented a Notion × VS Code hybrid modal for creating new files and folders, replacing browser-native `prompt()` calls with a custom React component.
- **Enhanced File Creation Workflow**: Added comprehensive input validation, duplicate prevention, and smooth animations for new file/folder creation.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Implemented Ctrl+N (new file) and Ctrl+Shift+N (new folder) keyboard shortcuts for improved productivity.
- **Modal Design System**: Created a reusable modal component with backdrop blur, smooth animations, and responsive design using theme CSS variables.

### Architecture Improvements

- **Controller-Driven Design**: Maintained clean separation between UI and business logic - modal handles presentation, controllers handle filesystem operations.
- **State Management**: Implemented proper modal state management with controlled components and callback patterns.
- **Input Validation**: Added comprehensive filename validation including invalid character checks and duplicate detection.
- **Accessibility**: Included proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation (Enter/Escape), and focus management.

### Breaking Changes

### 🎨 New Features

- **Study Context & Focus Mode**: Global state context managing active tools and distraction-free learning. Toggle Focus Mode (Ctrl+Shift+F) to hide the left sidebar and focus entirely on the editor/study tools.
- **Settings System**: Instant-save application preferences modal (Ctrl+,) handling general defaults and Pomodoro timer intervals, scaling instantly across both local storage (hot path) and backend filesystem persistence.
- **Pomodoro Timer**: Native deep integration handling full work/break/long-break lifecycles perfectly. Built with a clean interface inside the right side-panel and a minimal ring widget attached natively to the bottom status bar.
- **Study Statistics**: Activity tracking system logging deep focus sessions building into dynamic streak-counters, timeline history data, and a 100% native SVG bar graph rendering natively inside the application without relying on external bloat.
- **Flashcards System**: A deck manager allowing question/answer creations with smooth 3D CSS flip animations natively driven alongside seamless keyboard integrations (Space, Arrows, Shuffle). Currently acts as a foundational block anticipating AI note synthesis features locally.
- **Notes Synthesis**: Document combination utility capable of fusing multiple Markdown or text files recursively into structured unified documents. Anticipates future deep docx/pdf local integrations natively.
- **Refactored Right Panel**: Implemented `RightPanelContainer` routing between dynamic sub-panels seamlessly (Calendar vs Study Modes) allowing complete customization over how you allocate your workspace view.

### Architecture

- **Flexible Data Store**: Introduced a generalized `study.rs` generic backend trait allowing robust read/save behaviors seamlessly handling isolated tool datasets (`stats.json`, `flashcards.json`, `settings.json`) independently.
- **Hook-Driven Capabilities**: Encapsulated state machines inside pure functional hooks natively (`usePomodoro`, `useFlashcards`, `useStudyStats`) allowing un-coupled logic implementation seamlessly testable offline natively.

## [v0.5.0] - Theme System Overhaul

### Breaking Changes

- **ThemeContext API rewrite**: `useTheme()` now returns `{ activeThemeName, themes, setTheme, saveUserTheme, deleteUserTheme, duplicateTheme, isThemeEditorOpen, setThemeEditorOpen, refreshThemes, workspaceRoot }` instead of the previous `{ theme, setTheme, customThemes, applyCustomTheme }`.
- **ThemeProvider** now accepts an optional `workspaceRoot` prop and has been moved from `main.tsx` into `App.tsx`.
- **`editorConfig.ts`**: Removed `registerHibiscusThemes()` — themes are now managed exclusively by the dynamic CSS adapter.
- **Deleted** `monacoStudyConfig.ts` — was dead code duplicating `editorConfig.ts`.

### New Features

- **JSON Theme System**: Themes are defined as JSON with full token overrides (`--bg`, `--text`, `--editor-keyword`, etc.), stored in `.hibiscus/themes/<name>.json`.
- **Theme Editor UI**: In-app modal with color pickers for Core, Editor, and Semantic token groups. Instant live preview via direct CSS variable manipulation.
- **Theme Registry** (`themeRegistry.ts`): Centralized frontend theme management with `applyTheme()`, `safeApplyTheme()`, `validateTheme()`, `mergeWithDefaults()`, and JSON serialization.
- **Theme Defaults** (`themeDefaults.ts`): Preset themes (midnight, dawn, forest) as static JSON objects with all tokens defined. Presets are read-only; duplicate to edit.
- **Export/Import** (`themeIO.ts`): Export themes as downloadable `.hibiscus-theme.json` files; import and validate JSON theme files.
- **Backend Persistence**: Three new Tauri commands — `save_theme`, `load_themes`, `delete_theme` — for persisting user themes to `.hibiscus/themes/*.json`.
- **Theme Selector Improvements**: Status bar dropdown now shows Preset and Custom sections, active checkmark, and action buttons for "Edit Theme..." and "Import Theme...".
- **TitleBar Integration**: View menu now includes "Theme..." action to open the Theme Editor.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed invalid CSS**: Editor-specific tokens (`--editor-fg`, `--editor-keyword`, etc.) were declared outside any CSS selector (bare properties between `:root` closing brace and `[data-theme]` blocks). Browsers silently ignored them. Moved inside `:root` with per-theme overrides.
- **Fixed runtime crash**: `editorThemeAdapter.ts` called `strip()` but the function was named `stripHash()`. Caused `ReferenceError` at runtime.
- **Fixed Monaco theme reference**: Editor config referenced `hibiscus-soft` theme which was never registered before editor creation. Changed to `hibiscus-dynamic` (the CSS-adapter-defined theme).
- **Fixed Monaco not updating on theme switch**: `setTheme()` previously only changed `data-theme` attribute but never re-triggered `applyEditorThemeFromCSS()`. Monaco now syncs on every theme change.
- **Fixed Monaco background transparency conflict**: `EditorView.css` had `background-color: transparent !important` overriding the dynamic theme adapter's `editor.background` setting. Removed the `!important` override.
- **Fixed dead code**: Removed unused imports of `getStudyEditorOptions` and `registerHibiscusThemes` from `EditorView.tsx`.

### 🏗️ Architecture

- **Editor theme adapter** rewritten with intelligent light/dark base theme detection (luminance calculation instead of hardcoded hex comparison), comprehensive fallback chains for all CSS variables, and new token support (`--editor-line-highlight`, `--editor-cursor`).
- **Strict separation maintained**: Editor behavior/config remains fixed and non-editable; theme system is fully user-editable. Frontend owns all theme logic; backend provides persistence only.
