//! Hibiscus Application Entry Point
//! ============================================================================
//!
//! This is the main library entry point for the Hibiscus Tauri application.
//! It registers all modules, plugins, and Tauri commands.
//!
//! MODULES:
//! - commands: File and workspace operations
//! - error: Typed error handling
//! - tree: Directory tree builder
//! - watcher: Filesystem change monitoring
//! - workspace: Workspace data structures
//! - knowledge: Local-first knowledge indexing system (Phase 1 + Phase 2)
//! ============================================================================

///
/// KNOWLEDGE SYSTEM LIFECYCLE:
/// 1. `KnowledgeState` is created and shared via `Arc` before the builder runs.
/// 2. One Arc clone is registered with Tauri's managed state (for command access).
/// 3. Another Arc clone is passed to `spawn_knowledge_worker` in the setup hook.
/// 4. The background worker task takes the receiver from the shared state and
///    begins draining the event channel once events arrive.
/// 5. The watcher thread sends `FileEvent` values through the channel's sender,
///    which the worker picks up, debounces, and processes.
